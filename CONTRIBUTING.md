# Contributing to Just-d

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We are building a high-performance UI library, and we value clarity and precision.

## ⚡️ The Async Workflow

We operate on an **Async-First** culture. To ensure smooth collaboration without synchronous meetings, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Detailed Issues**: Before coding, open an issue describing the problem or feature.
2.  **Context-Rich PRs**: Your Pull Request description should explain *why* and *how*, not just *what*.
3.  **Video/Visuals**: If you change the UI, attach a video or GIF. We care about "feel" and 60fps performance.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Motion**: Framer Motion (use `layoutId` for shared element transitions)
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict mode)

## 📝 Commit Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
