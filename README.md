## 👨‍💻 Author's Note (Async Culture)

I built Just-d to solve a recurring problem in high-stakes projects: **The need for speed without sacrificing quality.** This repository reflects my engineering values:
1.  **Documentation is King**: Clear code > long meetings.
2.  **Performance is a Feature**: If it lags, it's broken.
3.  **Async-First**: Built with detailed commits and architectural clarity to facilitate global collaboration.
